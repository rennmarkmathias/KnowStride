          7. Cossack Hetmanate — Leadership and Military Tradition
        </summary>

        <div style="margin-top:14px;">
          <p>
            In the middle of the 1600s, a new political order appeared on the steppe and forest-steppe
            borderlands of Eastern Europe: the Cossack Hetmanate. It emerged from a society shaped by
            river crossings, raids, seasonal campaigns, and the practical demands of defending
            scattered settlements.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leadership in this environment was never simply “civil” or “military”.
            The same figures who negotiated with neighboring powers also raised regiments,
            managed supply lines, and enforced discipline.
          </p>
