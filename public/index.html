            7. Cossack Hetmanate — Leadership and Military Tradition
          </summary>

          <div style="margin-top:14px; line-height:1.55;">
            <p><strong>A frontier polity built around arms and negotiation</strong> — In the mid-1600s, the Cossack Hetmanate emerged along Eastern Europe’s steppe frontier, where raids, river crossings, and seasonal campaigns shaped daily security. Leadership was never purely “civil” or “military”: the same figures negotiated with neighbors, raised regiments, managed supply, and enforced discipline. At its height, the Hetmanate controlled much of central Ukraine; its territorial regiments functioned as both armed forces and administration.</p>

            <p><strong>From uprising to Hetmanate: a brief background</strong> — The state grew out of the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648) against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as demands for autonomy and protection hardened into a political structure. The 1654 alignment with Muscovy created a new strategic frame without ending the need to balance patrons and rivals. Civil war, shifting coalitions, and later imperial tightening narrowed autonomy over time, until abolition came in stages during the 1700s.</p>

            <p><strong>The hetman and the “starshyna”: who led, and how</strong> — The hetman served as head of government, chief diplomat, and commander-in-chief. Elections existed in principle, but power often concentrated among senior officers (the <em>starshyna</em>) who controlled logistics, justice, and the chancery. Rule depended on reputation, patronage, and the ability to hold regimental loyalty. In this world, legitimacy tracked military competence—especially control of towns and river corridors.</p>

            <p><strong>Regiments as both army and state</strong> — The regiment (<em>polk</em>) was a district and a fighting unit, made up of companies and led by colonels who were administrators as well as commanders. Mobilization could reach tens of thousands, but numbers rose and fell with season, supply, and unity. Councils and oath-taking anchored a public ideal of consent, while campaigns demanded hierarchy. That constant negotiation shaped both resilience and internal fracture.</p>

            <p><strong>Training, tactics, and the steppe-war repertoire</strong> — Cossack warfare was built for mobility: fast marches, local foraging, and intimate knowledge of rivers, wetlands, and forest edges. Defense mattered as much as attack—wagon laagers, field works, and fortified towns assumed sudden pressure. The Hetmanate also absorbed methods from Polish-Lithuanian, Ottoman, Tatar, and Muscovite/Russian warfare, and later faced growing imperial standardization in drills, ranks, and supply.</p>

            <p><strong>Summary</strong> — The Hetmanate fused governance and warfare into one political language: officers governed because they could mobilize, protect, and negotiate. Its strengths—adaptability, readiness, and a workable blend of councils and command—also made it vulnerable to factional splits and external oversight. The long debate was never only military: it was about how self-rule should be defined, defended, and anchored in institutions.</p>
